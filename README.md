<h1>Price Prediction Model</h1>

This is the Supervised Machine Learning project. Banglore Housing Price dataset is used in this model which we get from kaggle. 
TechStack Used is:- 
  1.Pandas
  2.Sci-kit learn
  3.Numpy

Firstly I preprocessed the data so as to remove the discrpenceies like missing values, duplicate values. We either replace the values by average values or by highest frequency value
After preprocessing we do some feature engineering which make our data more feasible for the model to train and provide better results.

Then we split the data into train and test dataset. Train dataset is used to train the model whereas Test dataset to evaluate the model
I trained the model on Linear regression model and Ridge Regression model and compared the accuracy level of both to opt for best model possible.

This project provided me the overview of how the model preprocessed and trained.
